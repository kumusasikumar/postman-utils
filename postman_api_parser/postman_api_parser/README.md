# Postman Tag Parser

## Quickstart

`cd` to this directory.

Run  
`python api_parser.py <path>`  
where the path is the location of the postman collection JSON file to be parsed

By default, the output will be located in your current working directory, suffixed with "_parsed.json". A QA report will also be generated suffixed with "_report.json".
